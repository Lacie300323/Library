## Getting Started

### Step 1
Download the ZIP file from this repository

### Step 2

Include the Javascript Library file and the CSS file in the <head> of your HTML file. Make sure to
also add the __<script> "onload"__ as shown below.
```
  <head>
		<title>Library</title>
		
		<!--Stylesheet-->
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/index.css">

		<!--Scripts-->
		<script src="js/library.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			window.onload = function()
			{

			}
		</script>
```
The CSS file can be changed to your liking and does not intervene with the library script.


##How to Use

In order to use the functions in the Colorfy Library you have to include the function together with
the html element as shown below:
```
  <head>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			window.onload = function()
			{
				//Changes color of the selector every interval
				$('#box2').randomcol()
			}
		</script>
```
Here the HTML element is the ID box2 and the function is called .randomcol()
